This project is a user-friendly website made using JavaScript for functionality and Figma for design. It helps people find and keep track of TV shows they want to watch. Users browse through various categories like drama, comedy, action, or fantasy to discover new shows. If they find something they like, they can easily add it to their watchlist, which is a personalized list of shows they plan to watch later. The website has a clean and simple design, making it easy for anyone to navigate and find their next favorite show.
